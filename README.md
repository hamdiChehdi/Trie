# Trie
Trie (Prefix Tree) implementation in C#
with insert, search, and startsWith methods.

- insert: O(n) complexity (size of the inserted word)
- search: O(n) complexity (size of the word)
- startsWith: O(n) complexity (size of the prefix)

All operation has a Linear time, the height of trie equal to the longest word size in the Trie
